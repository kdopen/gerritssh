* Eduardo Felipe for his backport of subprocess.check_output to python 2.6. 
  Available at https://gist.github.com/edufelipe/1027906

* David Pursehouse and the people at Sony Xperia Developer World for their 
  excellent pygerrit repository at https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/pygerrit
  from which I have taken the core of the ssh.py module to avoid reinventing
